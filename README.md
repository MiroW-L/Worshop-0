# Worshop-0


##Introduction: 8/1/25 (First Online Meet)

I haven’t ever done coding before so I’m super excited about it. I haven’t used Github before so I’m excited to figure that out. I’m curious if we will do any that could be like a point and click story game because that would be really fun for someone like myself. 

Leo showed us a piece someone made last year that was a choose your own adventure type game which made me feel excited. Leo seems confidant and explained which we would be able to work with involving the audience (a la performance art) and getting the audience to input keys so that sounds really fun, might look into that after I view the first few workshop videos.

Leo is talking lots about the consequences of computers existing which is really interesting, making me think lots about consequences and how the idea of computers and their consequences is kinda swept under the rug, kept out of sight out of mind.

Now Beginning to write some code. Write an algorithm for a drawing. Uh oh I failed Leo’s pseudocode test ahhh. Just need to focus and not space out.

- Will be learning JavaScript - library of pre-written code
- Will be using p5.js - free and open source tool used by artists
- Will be using Github

##Workshop 0 and p5.js (8-10/1/25)

Okay so the plan is to watch these videos and then do some of my own research into how to use the p5.js tool.

In this video Leo taught us how to use variables and conditionals and so my own experimentation with rectangles and moving them across a digital canvas, as well as changing their sizes and colours. It reminds me a lot of maths grids, like calculating X and Y values on grids.

##Finished product of a little experimenting

In this is a video of my finished product, which moves and changes colours

It was a little fussy to get the colour to change but I eventually solved it, even though I think I brute forced it and didn’t utilise the ; and } { command things, those still confuse me a little bit. I might re-watch the video and see if it makes more sense after a second viewing.

I didn’t realise my music was playing through but its bob dylan if that’s okay
