## Workshop 0 and p5.js (8-10/1/25)

Okay so the plan is to watch these videos and then do some of my own research into how to use the p5.js tool.

In this video Leo taught us how to use variables and conditionals and so my own experimentation with rectangles and moving them across a digital canvas, as well as changing their sizes and colours. It reminds me a lot of maths grids, like calculating X and Y values on grids.

## Finished product of a little experimenting

In this is a video of my finished product, which moves and changes colours

It was a little fussy to get the colour to change but I eventually solved it, even though I think I brute forced it and didn’t utilise the ; and } { command things, those still confuse me a little bit. I might re-watch the video and see if it makes more sense after a second viewing.

I didn’t realise my music was playing through but its bob dylan if that’s okay
